# FLatt_Pack_dist
### Welcome to the public Git for the FLatt Pack installer.
***
Here you can download the newest version of FLatt Pack.

* Current version: 3.10
* Last update: 21st January 2021
* License expiry date: 28th February 2022

A few notes on installation and use:
1. **To ensure the program runs without error, it is best to install it in your user space (your *Documents* folder or similar) rather than *C:\Program Files*.**  If you have admin rights on the PC, you should be able to install it anywhere without problem.

2. The software installer will automatically connect to the internet to download the Matlab Runtime environment.  This can take around 20 minutes.  Subsequent installations (such as updated versions of the software) will bypass this step and will be quite quick.

3. Please be aware that this is very much a product in-development.  The chance of you encountering a bug of some kind is non-zero.  Get in touch and Iâ€™ll try to fix it.  I rely on feedback from users of the software to identify bugs and make improvements.

4. **Every time the program is run, a log file (*FLatt_Pack_log.txt*) will be generated.  If you have any problems, please attach the log file when you contact me.**  That way, I will be able to diagnose and fix the issue as quickly as possible.  

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any problems or cannot obtain the lattice design you have in mind.  Email: ian.maskery@nottingham.ac.uk

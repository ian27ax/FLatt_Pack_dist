# FLatt Pack (the Functional Lattice Package)
### Welcome to the public Git for the FLatt Pack installer.
You can download the newest version of FLatt Pack under the **'Releases'** section of this page.

It is maintained by [Ian Maskery](https://www.ianmaskery.com/) of the University of Nottingham.  If interested, you can find the associated *Additive Manufacturing* journal article about this program [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214860421006576).  
***
* **Current version:** 3.61
* **Last update:** 10th April 2025
* **License expiry date:** 30th September 2025

**Please read** these notes on installation and use:

1. **To ensure the program runs without error, install FLatt Pack in your user space (your *Documents* folder or similar) rather than *C:\Program Files*.**  If you have admin rights on the PC, you should be able to install it anywhere without problem.

2.  A user manual is installed along with the main FLatt Pack program. It will guide you through the main operations of FLatt Pack and the features in its GUI.

3. The software installer will download the Matlab Runtime environment from the web.  This can take around 10 minutes.  Subsequent installations (such as updated versions of the software) will bypass this step and will be quite quick.

4. Please be aware that this is a product in-development and is used principally for research.  The chance of you encountering a bug of some kind is non-zero.  Get in touch and Iâ€™ll try to fix it.  I rely on feedback from software users and fellow researchers o identify bugs and make improvements.

4. **Every time the program is run, a log file (*FLatt_Pack_log.txt*) will be generated and stored in the installation folder.  If you have any problems, please attach the log file when you contact me.**  That way, I will be able to diagnose and fix the issue as quickly as possible.  

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any problems or cannot obtain the lattice design you have in mind.  Email: ian.maskery@nottingham.ac.uk

# FLatt_Pack_dist
### Welcome to the public Git for the FLatt Pack installer.
***
Here you can download the newest version of FLatt Pack.

* Current version: 3.10
* Last update: 4th August 2020
* License expiry date: 30th November 2020

A few notes on installation and use:
1. The first time the software is installed on a PC, it will connect to the internet to download the Matlab Runtime environment.  This can take around 20 minutes, depending on your connection speed.  Subsequent installations (such as updated versions of the software) will bypass this step and will be almost instantaneous.  If this is a problem I can send another version which has the Runtime bundled.

2. Please be aware that this is very much a product in-development.  The chance of you encountering a bug of some kind is non-zero.  Get in touch and I’ll try to fix it for you.  I rely on feedback from users of the software to identify bugs and make improvements.

3. Every time the program is run, a log file (FLatt_Pack_log.txt) will be generated.  If you have any problems, please attach the log file when you contact me.  That way, I will be able to diagnose and fix the issue as quickly as possible.  Note – to ensure the log file is generated every time the software is run, it is best to install the software in your user space (your documents folder or similar) rather than C:\Program Files.  If you have admin rights on the PC, you should be able to install it anywhere without problem.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any problems or cannot obtain the lattice design you have in mind.  Email: ian.maskery@nottingham.ac.uk
